// Express apps can use any database mechanism supported by Node (Express itself doesn't define any specific additional behavior/requirements for database management). 
// There are many options, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.

// In order to use these you have to first install the database driver using npm. For example, 
// to install the driver for the popular NoSQL MongoDB you would use the command:
npm install mongodb
