// we defined a (callback) route handler function for HTTP GET requests to the site root ('/').
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
    res.send("Hello World!");
});
/*
The callback function takes a request and a response object as arguments. In this case, the method calls
send() on the response to return the string "Hello World!" There are a number of other response methods 
for ending the request/response cycle, for example, you could call res.json() to send a JSON response 
or res.sendFile() to send a file.
*/
/*
There is a special routing method, app.all(), which will be called in response to any HTTP method. This is 
used for loading middleware functions at a particular path for all request methods. The following 
example (from the Express documentation) shows a handler that will be executed for requests to /secret 
irrespective of the HTTP verb used
*/
app.all("/secret", function (req, res, next) {
    console.log("Accessing the secret sectionâ€¦");
    next(); // pass control to the next handler
});
/*
Routes allow you to match particular patterns of characters in a URL, and extract some values from the URL 
and pass them as parameters to the route handler (as attributes of the request object passed as a parameter).

Often it is useful to group route handlers for a particular part of a site together and access them using 
a common route-prefix (e.g. a site with a Wiki might have all wiki-related routes in one file and have them 
accessed with a route prefix of /wiki/). In Express this is achieved by using the express.Router object. For 
example, we can create our wiki route in a module named wiki.js, and then export the Router object, as shown below:
*/
// wiki.js - Wiki route module

const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

// Home page route
router.get("/", function (req, res) {
    res.send("Wiki home page");
});

// About page route
router.get("/about", function (req, res) {
    res.send("About this wiki");
});

module.exports = router;
/*
To use the router in our main app file we would then require() the route module (wiki.js), then call use() on 
the Express application to add the Router to the middleware handling path. The two routes will then be 
accessible from /wiki/ and /wiki/about/.
*/
const wiki = require("./wiki.js");
app.use("/wiki", wiki);
